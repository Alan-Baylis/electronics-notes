## Voltage regulators

Generally indicated with a code like L78XXCV, where XX indicated the Vout voltage.

An important value to look at in the datasheet is the **drop voltage** that indicates
what is the minimum difference between the Vin voltage and the Vout in order to maintain
a stable voltage.
