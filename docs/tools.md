## Oscilloscope

The main parameter is the bandwidth: as explainded by [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2012/01/27/why-oscilloscope-bandwidth-matters/)
*The bandwidth of an oscilloscope actually indicates the point at which
the measured amplitude on an amplitude/frequency chart has decreased by
-3dB (or 70.7%) of the original value*
