# Oscillator

Sometimes we need a timed signal to use as a clock (but also
for other things).

## General theory

The [Barkhausen stability criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkhausen_stability_criterion)
says that

 1. the loop gain exceeds unity at the resonant frequency
 2. the fase shift around the loop is $2\pi n$ (where $n\in N$)

bad enough seems that [the  Barkhausen Stability Criterion is simple, intuitive, and wrong](http://web.mit.edu/klund/www/weblatex/node4.html).

## Crystal

Quartz is a piezoelectric material. When an electric
field is placed upon it, a physical displacement occurs.
Interestingly enough, we can write an equivalent electrical
circuit to represent the mechanical properties of
the crystal.

## Negative resistance oscillator

Some active devices (like diode and transistor) have *zone* of **negative resistance** that can
be used to amplify the feedback loop of an oscillating circuit.
