# Diodes

This is semiconductor device that allows (usually) the flowing of current
only in one direction (this is called a **rectifier**).

The main parameters for a diode are

 - the forward voltage drop
 - the leaking current

## Zener

A Zener diode behaves differently from a normal diode: has a reverse-breakdown current
pre-determined and can be used as a voltage regulator. In other words, it allows flow
in both directions, it's like having two diodes in parallel with different voltage drops.

## Schottky

Are another kind of diode with lower forward voltage drop and fast switching speed but
with greater leakage current.
