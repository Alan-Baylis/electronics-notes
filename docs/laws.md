## Thevenin's Theorem

Any **linear** circuit can be simplified with a single voltage source
and a resistance in series.

The Thevenin voltage is an ideal voltage source
equal to the open circuit voltage at the terminals.

The Thevenin resistance r is the resistance measured
at terminals AB with all voltage sources replaced by short circuits and all
current sources replaced by open circuits.
