# Filters

A circuit can be seen as device that on an input function respondes
with a certain output function; since the main scope of the digital circuit
is to handle signals, the study of response is in the frequency space.

A way to study the response is by the **Bode plot** that shows


## Low pass filter

Are composed of a resistor with a capacitor

$$f = {1\over 2\pi RC}$$

$${V_O(s)\over V_I(s)} = {1\over RC\cdot s + 1}$$
