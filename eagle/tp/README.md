# Tiny Programmer

Inspired by [this](https://www.tindie.com/products/bot_thoughts/eezee-tiny-breakout-programming-board-kit/) programmer layout at Tindie.com I worked on a similar
concept

![board image](board.png)

It has a diode to protect programmer and power supply from each other current, has the
pin naming displayed and the header spacing allows to use in a breadboard (mounting
in the back side the header).

## TODO

 - Reset button
 - Decoupling capacitor
