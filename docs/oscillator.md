# Oscillator

Sometimes we need a timed signal to use as a clock (but also
for other things).

## Crystal

Quartz is a piezoelectric material. When an electric
field is placed upon it, a physical displacement occurs.
Interestingly enough, we can write an equivalent electrical
circuit to represent the mechanical properties of
the crystal.
