Simple breakout board to use with the RN42 bluetooth module.

This breakout exposes only the ``UART`` signals; can be used
with a voltage level different from the original 3.3V at which
is operating the RN42 module since this breakout contains a
voltage regulator and some components that do the conversion
for you from one logic level to another.

For more informations read the original [datasheet](0900766b811a8f51.pdf).
